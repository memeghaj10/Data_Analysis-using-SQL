# Data Analysis using SQL and Pandas


This is a `coursera project` that was completed by me, while trying to learn about the use of SQL in Data Science.

This uses the following data-sets:-

1. `Chicago_Crime_Data.csv`.

2. `Chicago_Public_Schools_-_Progress_Reports_Card_2011-12-v3.csv`.

3. `Census_Data_-_Selected_socioeconomic_indicators_in_Chicago_2008__2012-v2.csv`.

After loading the `IBM_Cloud` facilities and making app. connections following questions were answered using `SQL`,`Pandas` and `Matplotlib` along with `Seaborn` :-

1.  No. of crimes invloving arrests.

2. Which unique types of crimes have been recorded at GAS STATION locations?

3. What is the average school Safety Score?

4. List the top 5 Community Areas by average College Enrollment [number of students].

5. Use a sub-query to determine which Community Area has the least value for school Safety Score?

6. Finding the Per Capita Income of the Community Area which has a school Safety Score of 1. 


Hope to improve and work-upon more skills.
